Attached is code for a project (written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript).  

The code has three different issues.  

We would like you to find the problems, fix the problems, and explain your trouble shooting process.

The problems should be fairly obvious.  

If you can’t find one of the problems or a solution to a problem, then please write up where you struggled.  

It will help us improve the process (we’re always looking to improve) and it will show your tenacity. 

We've provided a version of the bugged code within the part2/deliverables folder.
