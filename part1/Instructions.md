Our advertisements or “ad units” are often built out of only six pieces of information: an icon, a larger image, category, title, description, and a call-to-action.

These six pieces are assembled and laid out in different ways (using templates).  

Within the part1/image_components folder we have included two pieces of data from an advertiser, an icon and a larger image.

We've also included within part1/image_components folder some images of stars to help make your job easier.

The four remaining text pieces of the ad from our advertiser are:

Category: “Productivity”
Title: “Automate Any Home”
Description: “with Homebot”
Call-to-action: “Install Now”

A mockup image of a finished ad unit is stored in the part1/mockups folder.

First we would like you to write the HTML and CSS to recreate as close as possible the finished ad unit.

As well, we would like you to create a second ad unit of your own. Feel free to impress and wow us.

We've provided a part1/deliverables/css folder for your css and a part1/deliverables/html folder for your work.

Hint: The "free" ribbon in the bottom right hand corner of the ad_unit_one.png image was created with CSS.  If this hangs you up, don't fret.  Please just submit the closest version to you mock up that you can create.
