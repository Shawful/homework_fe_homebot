Without using any frameworks or libraries (no use of AngularJS/Backbone/React/jQuery/etc…) use Javascript to display your recreation of the first ad unit and your new ad unit based on a user’s selection.

The user is expected to select from either of the two ads you have selected.  

You may lay out the page however you see fit as long as there is a clear section for the user to choose which ad they would like displayed, and another section where the selected ad may be viewed.

The idea here is that you are creating a showcase or gallery of the ads that you made earlier in the previous parts of this homework. 

As with the previous parts of the homework, please use the /part3/deliverables folder for your work.  

Feel free to utilize the part3/deliverables/css folder for your css as well as the corresponding /part3/deliverables folders for your html and js.
