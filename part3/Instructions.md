Without using any frameworks or libraries (no use of AngularJS/Backbone/React/jQuery/etc…) use Javascript to display your recreation of the first two ad units and your new ad unit based on a user’s selection.

As with the previous parts of the homework, please use the /part3/deliverables folder for your work.  

Feel free to utilize the part3/deliverables/css folder for your css as well as the corresponding /part3/deliverables folders for your html and js.
