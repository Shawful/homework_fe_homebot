# Homework_Homebot

The homework assignment consists of three different parts (don't worry, this will be fun).

Each part of the problem has a corresponding folder named for that portion of the homework (part1,  part2, part3).

Each folder will have and Instructions.md file to help explain that part of the homework assignment and guide your efforts.

When instructions are unclear, use your best judgement.



Deliverables:

Each part has a /deliverables folder which should contain your work for that portion of the homework.

When finished, please zip your top level homework_homebot folder and email the zipped file to jobs@kixer.com.
